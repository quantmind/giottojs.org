description: Draw one serie against to obtain a scatter plot
date: 2014 December 26

A scatter plot is a relatively straghtforward chart where one plot the values
of serie A versus the values of a serie B in a cartesian coordinate system.

The value of x and y are the visible properties of the scatter plot.
Additionally, other properties can be included such as the mark to use (circle, square, etc..),
the color, the size and so forth. We call all these visible properties the *aestetics*.
